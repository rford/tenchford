# How Fast?

One of the most frequent questions I get while riding around is  "How fast can
you go?"  

The world record for an hour ride on  a trike is 70.68 Km. 
[WWW.ihpv.org](http://www.ihpva.org/hpvarecl.htm#nom1h2)  set by Pieter Pas out
of Germany.  Their trike is fully faired
[cygnushpv.blogspot.ca](http://cygnushpv.blogspot.ca) and not something I would be
willing  to ride on  city streets.

I ride a catrike speed.  A nice little aluminum frame trike, but no fairing.

How fast?   Well I have had it up in the  70km/h range  for a  short  distance
while going  down hill. My max on  the  flat would be  about  50km/h   mostly
I  am not concerned with going fast.  I  prefer just laying back and taking  my
time.

  It  is  the  ride that is  important not the score.  What ever bike  you like
to ride  get out  and  ride.
