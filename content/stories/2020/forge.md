# Forging 

##Side draw chimney

I am using a little 10 gallon steel drum as my side draw forge chimney.  I
rescued the drum and the grain bin steel siding from a near-by dump. 

The forge I have been using in the local museum is side-draft as are most of the  smith's in the area.  I like the 
side draft style as it leaves the fire unobstructed  and actually pulls the
smoke in much better than most overhead hoods.

I went cheap inspired by  [shady grove](https://www.blksmth.com/coal-forge-hood-simple-inexpensive/ ) and really like how the
round forge and round hood look together.
