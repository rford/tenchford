# Facelift for old site


If you can read this then I got my website changed over.  I
had been using some homebrew scripts and templating patterns
that I had created decades ago.  Mostly because templating engines did not exist yet.

I looked at a few different static site generators, most were far too complex
for what I wanted.   [Hugo][2] was a good
choice but I need the ablity to modify it easily.  So I went with
[staticsite][1] [[archive]][1a] written in python it uses [jinja2][3] templating and the
[markdown][4] language.  It was very simple to use and closely resembeled my own
ancient scripts.
